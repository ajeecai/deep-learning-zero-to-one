# Deep Learning From Zero To One Series

This repository documents my journey of building deep learning projects from 0 to 1. The goal is to gain a deeper, hands-on understanding of the core principles behind foundational models in deep learning and large language models (LLMs). Each project is my attempt to take a deep dive into the implementation details, trying to understand the core mechanics and potential pitfalls.

## Projects

- **Neural Machine Translation - NMT**
  - A complete workflow for an English-to-Chinese translation model based on the Transformer architecture. See `nmt/README.md` for details.
